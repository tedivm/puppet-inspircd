#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-  CLASS CONFIGURATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-
#                                                                     #
#   Classes are a group of commands which are grouped together and    #
#   given a unique name. They're used to define which commands        #
#   are available to certain types of Operators.                      #
#                                                                     #
#                                                                     #
#  Note: It is possible to make a class which covers all available    #
#  commands. To do this, specify commands="*". This is not really     #
#  recommended, as it negates the whole purpose of the class system,  #
#  however it is provided for fast configuration (e.g. in test nets). #
#                                                                     #

     #  VIEWING:
     #   - channels/auspex: allows opers with this priv to see more detail about channels than normal users.
     #   - users/auspex: allows opers with this priv to view more details about users than normal users, e.g. real host and IP.
     #   - servers/auspex: allows opers with this priv to see more detail about server information than normal users.
     # ACTIONS:
     #   - users/mass-message: allows opers with this priv to PRIVMSG and NOTICE to a server mask (e.g. NOTICE $*)
     #   - channels/high-join-limit: allows opers with this priv to join <channels:opers> total channels instead of <channels:users> total channels.
     # PERMISSIONS:
     #   - users/flood/no-fakelag: prevents opers from being penalized with fake lag for flooding (*NOTE)
     #   - users/flood/no-throttle: allows opers with this priv to send commands without being throttled (*NOTE)
     #   - users/flood/increased-buffers: allows opers with this priv to send and receive data without worrying about being disconnected for exceeding limits (*NOTE)
     #
     # *NOTE: These privs are potentially dangerous, as they grant users with them the ability to hammer your server's CPU/RAM as much as they want, essentially.
